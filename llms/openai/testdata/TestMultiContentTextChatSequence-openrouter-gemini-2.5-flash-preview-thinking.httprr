Recognizing \"larger\" implies area, I moved to gather data. Right now, I'm recalling Spain's details, which include its capital, continent, and crucially, its approximate area, around 505,990 square kilometers. Next step: Lesotho.\n\n\n**Evaluating Relative Areas**\n\nI've gathered the essential information for Lesotho: its capital is Maseru, it's in Africa, and it occupies roughly 30,355 kmÂ². Now, the key step is a direct comparison. I'm ready to perform the comparison to confirm and precisely answer the core question about relative sizes, leveraging the gathered data.\n\n\n"}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":12,"completion_tokens":271,"total_tokens":283}}
