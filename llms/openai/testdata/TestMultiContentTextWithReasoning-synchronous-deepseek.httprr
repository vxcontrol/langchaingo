So, I should recall what a factorial is.\n\nFactorial of a number n, denoted as n!, is the product of all positive integers from 1 up to n. For example, 5! means 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1.\n\nNow, I need to calculate that step by step. Let me start from 5 and multiply down to 1.\n\nSo, 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1\n\nI can multiply these numbers in sequence to make it easier.\n\nFirst, 5 × 4 = 20\n\nThen, 20 × 3 = 60\n\nThen, 60 × 2 = 120\n\nFinally, 120 × 1 = 120\n\nI know that multiplying by 1 doesn't change the number, so 120 is the result.\n\nI can also think of factorials recursively, but for this, direct multiplication is fine.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me list out the multiplication:\n\nStart with 5\n\nMultiply by 4: 5 × 4 = 20\n\nMultiply by 3: 20 × 3 = 60\n\nMultiply by 2: 60 × 2 = 120\n\nMultiply by 1: 120 × 1 = 120\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nI recall that 5! is 120. That's a common factorial value.\n\nFor example, 4! is 24, and 5! is 5 × 24 = 120. That's another way to check.\n\nWhat's 4!? 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 4 × 3 = 12, 12 × 2 = 24, 24 × 1 = 24. So, 4! = 24.\n\nThen 5! = 5 × 4! = 5 × 24 = 120.\n\nSame result.\n\nI think I'm confident with this.\n\nNow, the question says \"show your work,\" so I need to present this step by step in my response.\n\nAlso, \"think before you answer\" – I've done that by reasoning it out.\n\nSo, for the answer, I should write:\n\nThe factorial of 5, denoted as 5!, is calculated as follows:\n\n5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1\n\n= (5 × 4) × 3 × 2 × 1\n\n= 20 × 3 × 2 × 1\n\n= (20 × 3) × 2 × 1\n\n= 60 × 2 × 1\n\n= (60 × 2) × 1\n\n= 120 × 1\n\n= 120\n\nTherefore, 5! = 120.\n\nI could write it more concisely, but showing each multiplication step makes it clear.\n\nSince it's a simple calculation, I can just state it.\n\nBut to follow the instruction, I'll show the work.\n\nFinally, box the answer as is common in such responses."},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":22,"completion_tokens":820,"total_tokens":842,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":661},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":22},"system_fingerprint":"fp_393bca965e_prod0425fp8"}
