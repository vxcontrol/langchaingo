Start with the definition:\n    `5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1`\n\n2.

I recognize the fundamental question is to calculate 5 factorial, but the \"show your work\" instruction is a critical constraint. I'll need to detail each step of the calculation.\n\n\n**Outlining the Solution**\n\nI've moved from definition to execution. I've got the expansion, 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, and the step-by-step calculations mapped out. I'm planning to present the work logically, including the factorial definition upfront for clarity.\n\n\n"}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":17,"completion_tokens":637,"total_tokens":654}}
