Let me recall their sizes.\n\nSpain is in Europe, pretty big. I think it's around 500,000 square kilometers. Lesotho is an enclave in South Africa. Small country, maybe around 30,000 square km? Let me confirm. Spain's area is approximately 505,992 square kilometers. Lesotho is about 30,355 square kilometers. So Spain is definitely much larger. \n\nWait, are there any other factors? Maybe population? Spain has around 47 million people, Lesotho has about 2.1 million. But the question is about size. So Spain is larger in both area and population. \n\nI should present the figures clearly. Maybe mention Spain's size first, then Lesotho, and highlight the difference. Also, note that Lesotho is landlocked and surrounded by South Africa, which is why it's smaller. The user might be curious about why such a small country exists. Also, Spain's location in Europe versus Lesotho in Africa. That's probably all they need. Make sure to state clearly Spain is much larger.\n"}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":33,"completion_tokens":362,"total_tokens":395}}
