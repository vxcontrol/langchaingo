It's simple on the surface: find the factorial of 5. But the directive to \"show your work\" is key. This means I need to articulate the steps involved, not just the final result. My focus is on clarity of explanation, not just on the numerical answer.\n\n\n**Elaborating the Steps**\n\nI'm now formalizing the process. I've broken down the calculation into distinct steps: defining the factorial, applying that definition to 5, expanding the expression, and calculating each multiplication to arrive at the final answer. I'm focused on making the calculation demonstrably clear.\n\n\n**Confirming the Methodology**\n\nI've reviewed the detailed steps to be taken. I'm verifying each stage, from the initial deconstruction of the prompt, through definition, application, and calculation. The importance of showing all the work is central. I'm now reviewing it to be clear, complete, and readily understood.\n\n\n"}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":17,"completion_tokens":727,"total_tokens":744}}
