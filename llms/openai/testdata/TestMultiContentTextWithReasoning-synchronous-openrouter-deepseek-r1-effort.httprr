Hmm, let me remember what a factorial is. From what I recall, the factorial of a number n, written as n!, is the product of all positive integers from 1 up to n. So, for example, 5! would be 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1. Let me check if that's right.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not mixing it up with something else. Factorials are used in permutations and combinations, right? Yeah, like arranging objects. So if you have 5 distinct objects, the number of ways to arrange them is 5!. So that should be 5 multiplied by each number below it down to 1. Let me write that out step by step.\n\nStarting with 5, then multiply by 4: 5 × 4 = 20. Then multiply that result by 3: 20 × 3 = 60. Next, multiply by 2: 60 × 2 = 120. Finally, multiply by 1: 120 × 1 = 120. So, putting it all together: 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me verify that again to be sure. Sometimes when I do multiplication step by step, I might make a mistake. Let me re-calculate:\n\nFirst step: 5 × 4 is indeed 20. Then 20 × 3: 20 times 3 is 60. Then 60 × 2 is 120, and 120 × 1 remains 120. Yep, that checks out. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the recursive definition of factorial. I think factorial can also be defined as n! = n × (n-1)! So, 5! = 5 × 4!. Then I need to find 4! which is 4 × 3!, and so on until 1! which is 1. Let's try that approach:\n\n5! = 5 × 4!\n4! = 4 × 3!\n3! = 3 × 2!\n2! = 2 × 1!\n1! = 1\n\nNow substitute back up:\n\n2! = 2 × 1! = 2 × 1 = 2\n3! = 3 × 2! = 3 × 2 = 6\n4! = 4 × 3! = 4 × 6 = 24\n5! = 5 × 4! = 5 × 24 = 120\n\nSame result. So that confirms it. Therefore, the factorial of 5 is 120. \n\nI wonder if there's another way to compute it, maybe using logarithms or something else? Probably not necessary here since it's a small number. Factorials grow really quickly, so 5! is manageable. For larger numbers, it's more efficient to use a calculator or a computer, but for 5, manual calculation is straightforward.\n\nJust to be absolutely thorough, let me list out all the factorials up to 5 to see the progression:\n\n1! = 1\n2! = 2 × 1 = 2\n3! = 3 × 2 = 6\n4! = 4 × 6 = 24\n5! = 5 × 24 = 120\n\nYep, each step multiplies by the next integer, and each result is correct. So 5! is definitely 120. I don't think I made any mistakes here. Both methods—direct multiplication and recursive step-by-step—give the same answer. \n\nAnother check: sometimes people confuse factorial with double factorial, which is the product of every other number. For example, 5!! = 5 × 3 × 1 = 15. But the question specifically asks for factorial, not double factorial, so that's not the case here. \n\nAlso, zero factorial is defined as 1, but that's not relevant here. Just making sure I didn't mix up any concepts. \n\nIn summary, after carefully calculating step by step and verifying through two different methods, I'm confident that the factorial of 5 is 120.\n"}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":22,"completion_tokens":1113,"total_tokens":1135}}
