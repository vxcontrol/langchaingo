Then I honed in on the key query: what type of mammal? The next step will be to logically connect the pieces to deliver a solid, accurate answer.\n\n\n**Refining the Classification**\n\nI'm now focusing on the taxonomic classification. I've moved from Pomeranian to dog, then to the broader categories of carnivore and mammal. Iâ€™m building the connection to the animal kingdom, ensuring the response is accurate and complete. Next, I intend to check the optional elaboration.\n\n\n**Mapping the Taxonomy**\n\nI've expanded the classification outline, focusing on the hierarchical levels to ensure no errors in the response. I've created a clear pathway from Pomeranian to animal, allowing for a seamless answer. Now, I'm integrating the optional elaboration to make the answer even more useful.\n\n\n"}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":13,"completion_tokens":589,"total_tokens":602}}
