To help me narrow it down, tell me:\n\n**1. What are you interested in safety features for?**\n\n*   **Cars/Vehicles:** (e.g., \"Tell me about safety features in modern cars,\" or \"What are the most important safety features to look for when buying a used car?\")\n*   **Home:** (e.g., \"What are some home safety features to prevent burglaries?\" or \"What fire safety features should I have in my home?\")\n*   **Workplace:** (e.g., \"What are common workplace safety features in a factory?\" or \"What safety features should I consider for an office environment?\")\n*   **Software/Online:** (e.g., \"What are the safety features of a social media platform?\" or \"What safety features should I look for in a password manager?\")\n*   **Products/Equipment:** (e.g., \"What are the safety features of a chainsaw?\" or \"What safety features does a baby stroller have?\")\n*   **Something else?** (Please specify!)\n\n**2. Are you interested in specific types of safety features?**\n\n*   **Prevention:** (e.g., features that prevent accidents or incidents from happening in the first place)\n*   **Protection:** (e.g., features that protect you during an accident or incident)\n*   **Detection/Warning:** (e.g., features that alert you to a potential hazard)\n*   **Response:** (e.g., features that help you respond to an accident or incident)\n\n**3. What level of detail are you looking for?**\n\n*   **General Overview:** (e.g., \"Just give me a basic understanding of common safety features.\")\n*   **More Detailed Explanation:** (e.g., \"Explain how specific safety features work.\")\n*   **Specific Examples:** (e.g., \"Give me examples of safety features in a particular product or situation.\")\n\nOnce I have this information, I can provide you with a much more relevant and helpful answer.\n\n**In the meantime, here are some *very general* examples of safety features across different areas:**\n\n*   **Cars:** Seatbelts, airbags, anti-lock brakes, electronic stability control, blind-spot monitoring.\n*   **Home:** Smoke detectors, carbon monoxide detectors, fire extinguishers, security systems, childproof locks.\n*   **Workplace:** Machine guards, safety glasses, hearing protection, ventilation systems, emergency exits.\n*   **Software:** Firewalls, antivirus software, encryption, two-factor authentication, privacy settings.\n\nLooking forward to your response so I can give you more specific information!\n"
