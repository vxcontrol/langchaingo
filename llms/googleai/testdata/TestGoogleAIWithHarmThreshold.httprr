            "text": "Okay, let's talk about safety features. To give you the most relevant information, I need a little more direction.  Safety features can be found in many different contexts.  To help me narrow it down, tell me:\n\n**1. What are you interested in regarding safety features?**\n\nFor example, are you interested in:\n\n*   **Cars/Vehicles:** (e.g., airbags, ABS, lane departure warning, crash testing)\n*   **Home Safety:** (e.g., smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, security systems, childproofing)\n*   **Workplace Safety:** (e.g., safety training, personal protective equipment (PPE), hazard communication)\n*   **Product Safety:** (e.g., toy safety standards, electrical safety, food safety)\n*   **Online Safety:** (e.g., strong passwords, phishing awareness, malware protection, privacy settings)\n*   **General Safety/First Aid:** (e.g., CPR, Heimlich maneuver, basic wound care)\n*   **Something else entirely?**\n\n**2. What is your goal in learning about these safety features?**\n\n*   Are you trying to **purchase something** and want to know what features to look for?\n*   Are you trying to **improve safety** in a specific environment?\n*   Are you doing **research** for a project?\n*   Are you just **curious**?\n\nOnce I know what you're interested in, I can give you much more specific and helpful information.\n\nIn the meantime, here's a little general information about safety features:\n\n*   **Purpose:** Safety features are designed to reduce the risk of injury, damage, or loss. They can prevent accidents from happening in the first place, or they can minimize the harm caused by an accident.\n\n*   **Types:** Safety features can be active (requiring action, like wearing a seatbelt) or passive (automatically engaged, like airbags). They can be technological (sensors, alarms) or procedural (rules, training).\n\n*   **Importance:** Safety features are crucial for protecting individuals, property, and the environment. They can save lives, prevent injuries, and reduce costs associated with accidents.\n\nI look forward to your response so I can give you more specific information.\n"
