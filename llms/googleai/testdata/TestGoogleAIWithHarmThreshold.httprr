Are you asking about safety features in:\n\n*   **Cars?** (e.g., airbags, ABS, lane departure warning)\n*   **Homes?** (e.g., smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, security systems)\n*   **Workplaces?** (e.g., safety glasses, hard hats, machine guards)\n*   **Software/Online?** (e.g., firewalls, encryption, two-factor authentication)\n*   **Something else entirely?**\n\nIn the meantime, here's a general overview of safety features and some common categories:\n\n**What are Safety Features?**\n\nSafety features are designed to reduce the risk of harm or injury. They can be preventative (aiming to stop accidents from happening in the first place) or protective (designed to minimize the damage if an accident does occur).\n\n**General Categories of Safety Features:**\n\n*   **Prevention:** These features aim to stop accidents before they happen.\n*   **Protection:** These features minimize the harm caused during an accident.\n*   **Warning/Alert:** These features alert people to potential hazards.\n*   **Control:** These features help manage or mitigate risks.\n*   **Containment:** These features prevent the spread of hazards.\n\n**Please tell me what area you're interested in, and I can provide more specific and detailed information.**\n"
